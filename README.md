This is stater code for using the bookdown package to write a book based on R Markdown and bookdown (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/ for how to compile this example. You should edit the author field of the index.Rmd file and provide a link to your personal web page (if you have one). Use the first two chapters (01-TBM.Rmd and 02-TBM.Rmd) as examples for completing the remaining three chapters (03-TBM.Rmd, 04-TBM.Rmd and 05-TBM.Rmd). Your completed book should look like (https://stat-ata-asu.github.io/TreeBasedModels/).
